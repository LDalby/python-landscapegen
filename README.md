python-landscapegen
===================

These scripts build a model landscape for [ALMaSS](http://almass.dk) using the python library _arcpy_ to access arcGIS features. A number [R](www.r-project.org)-scripts to prepare reference files need in ALMaSS are also available in this repository. ALMaSS is an agent based simulation system which itself is hosted on ccpforge. See more on the [ALMaSS project page](http://ccpforge.cse.rl.ac.uk/gf/project/almass/).

The methods have been developed for Danish landscapes, but are generic and can be applied anywhere where sufficient data is available. 
The application of the methods have been published in [Topping et al. 2015](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969715308597). 
A preprint version is available from [bioarxiv.org](http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2015/10/08/025833)
