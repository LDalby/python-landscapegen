===================

These scripts build a model landscape for [ALMaSS](http://almass.dk) using the python library _arcpy_ to access arcGIS features. A number [R-scripts](www.r-project.org) to  of ALMaSS is an agent based simulation system which itself is hosted on ccpforge. See more on the [ALMaSS project page](http://ccpforge.cse.rl.ac.uk/gf/project/almass/).

The methods have been developed for Danish landscapes, but are generic and can be applied anywhere where sufficient data is available. A paper discribing the application of the methods is currently under review.
